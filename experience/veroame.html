              As a
              <span class="light">Freelance Web/Front-End Developer</span>, I
              brought Veronica's portfolio to the next level. I built new
              sections, reworked existing sections, and made the codebase more
              manageable. I met with the client regularly for feedback and
              worked with her on best practices for design and development.

            <h2 class="large top-padding">Overview</h2>
            <h5>
              This client had a live portfolio that she coded from scratch, but
              as a designer, she wanted to make it pop a bit more. The goal was
              to add animations to the page to give it more personality. In
              addition, she wanted the page to scroll horizontally instead of
              vertically on desktop, to make it her portfolio stand out.
            </h5>
          </div>
          <img
            class="media-show"
            src="../imgs/screenshots/veroa/veroa.me_(iPhone 6_7_8 Plus).png"
            alt="View of home screen - mobile"
          />
          <div class="media-hide centered-div">
            <img
              class="top-padding"
              src="../imgs/screenshots/veroa/aboutmedesktop.jpg"
              alt="Home Screen - Desktop - Landscape"
            />
            <p>Home Screen</p>
          </div>

          <h2 class="large top-padding">Approach</h2>
          <h5>
            The first step was to make sure each section of the site would fit
            into one average-sized desktop screen (or larger). Upon turning the
            site horizontal, I reworked any CSS to make sure everything fit and
            looked professional.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            I then made sure that the site still worked on mobile, as the site
            was going to scroll vertically on tablets and phones.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            I worked closely with the client to work through any user experience
            issues I anticipated based on the desired look and feel of her
            portfolio site.

              "I needed help with coding my professional portfolio site. I had a
              design in mind and didn't want to go with a generic Squarespace or
              other template site. Nikki came to the rescue! She was responsive,
              easy to work with, and delivered exactly what we'd discussed. She
              set up expectations as we went along and I'm super happy with the
              results. Her rates are reasonable, her delivery was on time, and
              she had useful suggestions and feedback along the way. I wouldn't
              hesitate to work with her again."

            My edits were launched successfully, and the client was incredibly

            and idea live.
