              for the Jono Pandolfi Shopify Store, I built and customized
              functional Shopify components based on designs created by the
              agency's in-house designers.

          <h2 class="large">Overview</h2>
          <h5>
            The Jono Pandolfi team was looking to move from SquareSpace to
            Shopify, as well as to create both a store for wholesalers and the
            general public. The new store was to be professional and clean,
            showcasing their handmade products and stellar reviews.
          </h5>
        </div>

        <div class="work-section-no-border">
          <h2 class="large">Approach</h2>
          <h5>
            The designers created a site that I then translated into custom code
            for Shopify. My goal was to make reusable sections of code so that
            the Jono team could easily manipulate or edit if necessary in the
            future, without the need for a developer.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            I worked closely with the design team to make decisions on how
            elements would look on different screen sizes. We also made
            decisions on different animations and effects on click or hover.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            I created a custom filter to filter products for the general public,
            as the chosen theme did not have a built in filter. I edited the
            product pages to be able to show different products and images based
            on which variant was selected.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            The end site is very sleek, with custom reusable elements and quick
            loading times.
          </h5>

          <h2 class="large">Results</h2>
          <h5>
            The average order value immediately went up 30% after the new site
            was launched. This was due to the products being easier to find and
            the improved site navigation.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            The two separate stores made the site much easier to customers to
            navigate as well.
          </h5>
