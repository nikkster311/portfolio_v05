          <h5>
            The client was working through a freelancing website to get clients
            and wanted a way to take his business up a notch. He had many
            reviews and images, but no way to be found through a web search
            beyond the freelancing platform.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            He needed a website (including design and development) and hosting.
            The biggest need was to have a way for potential clients to reach
            him.

            <h2 class="large">Approach</h2>
            <h5>
              I designed and built a sleek website that showed off Alex's
              services, his past work, and client testimonials. His instagram
              feed was integrated as a gallery page and a contact page listing
              his service area was added.
            </h5>
            <h5>
              His site is hosted on our server. This way, I can monitor the site
              and jump in if anything goes wrong, rather than him trying to
              troubleshoot on his own.
            </h5>
            <h5>
              We also set his site up to monitor user interaction to improve his
              site in the future.
            </h5>

          <h2 class="large">Results</h2>
          <h5>
            Within two days of launch, a new client reached out to Alex through
            his website and the job was completed that weekend. The SEO we added
            to his site is helping customers find him through search engines.
